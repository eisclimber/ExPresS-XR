# ExPresS XR
ExPresS XR (**Ex**perimentation and **Pres**entation for **S**cience with Open**XR**) is a tookit for VR and XR in Unity.
Based on the OpenXR Standard, it aims is to help automate early stages of development by providing configurable base implementations of components that are expected to be useful for scientific XR projects.  

## Structure
Following the aim to the OpenXR standard itself, ExPresS XR aims to allow development for a multiptude of devices. 
That why the project does not only support VR headsets with controllers but also a controller-free mode that can be used with smartphones (+ a VR mount, like the Google Cardboard)

The project is divided into three categories: General, Experimentation and Presentation.
- General: Implementaions of configurable XR Rigs, Movement, XR-based UI and Interaction, aswell as in-editor tutorials
- Experimentation: Providing an easy solution to expor and collect data, automatic generation of a "clean" test environment, aswell as a fully customizable quizzing system
- Presentation: Options for displaying objects in VR in interesting ways that allow building virtual exhibitions with ease

Apart from the code itself the wiki features useful worklfow tutorials that aim to help inexperienced developers aswell as added (e.g. building end systems or scanning real world objects to be imported in the project)
